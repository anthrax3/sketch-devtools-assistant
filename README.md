Sketch DevTools Assistant
=========================

Sketch DevTools Assistant is a helper OSX application that works together with [Sketch DevTools]() solution and provides protocol handling functionality for `Jumpt To Code` feature of DevTools for the following list of IDEs:
- Atom
- Sublime Text
- WebStorm
- AppCode
- XCode
- MacVim

Without this app installed all the listed editors will not work with the `Jump To Code` feature of DevTool.

## Installation
1. Download an archive [Sketch DevTools Assistant.zip]() with compiled app and unzip it
2. Copy `Sketch DevTools Assistant.app` to the `Applications` folder
3. The compiled application isn't signed because I don't have Mac Developer subscription yet, thus you have to do one extra steps to make it work. Go to the `Applications` folder and right click on the `Sketch DevTools Assistant` app file and click `Open` item form context menu.
4. Run the application

## Compiling

If you don't want to use unsigned binary you can just clone this repo, compile the app, put it into the `Applications` folder and run it.
